# Introduction 
Hi, my name is Camden 👋, i'm a kernel developer which currectly resides in New Zealand. I love to go on hikes and learn new things.

## History
I first used Linux at the age of 7/8 and loved it. I used crouton a lot on my chromebook when I was at my first few schools, which is where I also learned python and started programming. In 2019 I started dahliaOS (An operating system based on Google Fuchsia) from pure boredom after school. The project caught the attention of many and which is where we are today.

## Facts
* My favourite colour is purple. 🟣
* The Pangolin UI is named after another shelled animal like the Armadillo. 🐚
* I use a server from 2007 to play games and to compile big projects on. 🖥️
* I'm currently working towards porting a few devices to fuchsia in the future. 🌸
