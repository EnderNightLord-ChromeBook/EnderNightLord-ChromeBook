## Introduction 
Hi, my name is Camden 👋, i'm a kernel developer which currectly resides in New Zealand. I love to go on hikes and learn new things.

### History
I first used Linux at the age of 7/8 and loved it. I used crouton a lot on my chromebook when I was at my first few schools, which is where I also learned python and started programming. In 2019 I started dahliaOS (An operating system based on Google Fuchsia) from pure boredom after school. The project caught the attention of many and which is where we are today.

### Facts
* My favourite colour is purple. 🟣
* The Pangolin UI is named after another shelled animal like the Armadillo. 🐚
* I'm currently working on SkiffOS and dahliaOS, I'm working a lot on the pinephone currently.
* I can get burned out a lot, so if you do find me to be burned out, maybe you could help give me a little motivation :).
